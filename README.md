# Kepavi

KEgg PAthway VIewer based on ~~cytoscape.js~~ [sigmajs](http://sigmajs.org/) and some [Linkurious](https://github.com/Linkurious/linkurious.js) plugins. 

* Performs flux balance analysis using [cobrapy](http://github.com/cobrapy) and maps results onto pathways.
* Visualize whole genome based models using [Biomodels](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/).
* Visualize pathways using KEGG layout.
* 2600 available genome based models.

## Why another pathway viewer ?

Because Kegg pathway viewer are complete but not very beautiful.

## Alternatives

*[escher](https://escher.github.io/)

## Future

Add metabolomics data processing functionalities like peaklist deisotoping, adducts/fragments annotation using  [mzOS](http://github.com/jerkos/mzOS)
